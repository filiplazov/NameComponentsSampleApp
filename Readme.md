# Name Components Sample App

A sample app that demonstrates the Foundation's `PersonNameComponents` and `PersonNameComponentsFormatter` APIs. You can either enter your name and let the APIs try to determine the correct name components or enter each component individually. It uses the formatter to display the various styles. The sample app is build completely in SwiftUI.
Inspired by Paul Hudson's Hacking Withs Swift + [Handling names correctly](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus/making-the-most-of-foundation/handling-names-correctly).
